## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Beam (cryptocurrency) seriously and value the input of security researchers and users in identifying vulnerabilities. If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability, please follow the steps below to report it to us.

1. **Email**: Send an email to support@beam.mw, including a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant screenshots or code samples. Please use the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report" for your email.

2. **Expectations**: Upon receiving your report, our security team will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours. We will then assess the vulnerability and provide you with updates on its status at least once a week until the issue is resolved.

3. **Accepted Vulnerabilities**: If your report is confirmed as a valid security vulnerability, we will work to fix the issue as soon as possible. We may ask for further information or assistance in resolving the vulnerability. Once resolved, we will notify you and may publicly acknowledge your contribution to improving Beam's security.

4. **Declined Vulnerabilities**: If your report is deemed not to be a valid security vulnerability, we will inform you of our decision and provide an explanation as to why the issue is not considered a vulnerability.

5. **Confidentiality**: Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability before we have had a chance to address it. We take the privacy of our users seriously, and any public disclosure of vulnerabilities may put them at risk.

Thank you for helping us keep Beam secure and improving its security for everyone. For more information, visit our website at https://beam.mw.
